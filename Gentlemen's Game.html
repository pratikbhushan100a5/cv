  <p><i>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association football (soccer). Governance is by the International Cricket Council (ICC) which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.</p></i><hr>
  <h1><u>Early Cricket</u></h1>
  <h3><strong><u>Origin</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Cricket was probably created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across Kent and Sussex.[1] The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 ("Old Style" Julian date, the year equating to 1598 in the modern calendar).</p>
  <p>There have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 1300 and concerns the future King Edward II playing at "creag and other games" in both Westminster and Newenden. It has been suggested that "creag" was an Olde English word for cricket but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of "craic", meaning "fun and games in general".[2]</p>
  <p>It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep’s wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a wicket gate) as the wicket.[3]</p><hr>
  <h1><u>18th Century Cricket</u></h1>
  <h3><strong><u>Patronage And Players</u></strong></h3>
<p>Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first "county teams" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing "local experts" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.[4] The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.</p>
<p>The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edwin Stead. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark.</p>

<hr><h1>19th Century Cricket</h1>
<p>The game also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted to "player action" as William Clarke created the travelling All-England Eleven in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed.</p>
<p>The growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.</p>
<p>In 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of overarm and in the same year Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was first published. W. G. Grace began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.</p>

<h1><u>20th Century Cricket</u></h1>
<h3><u>Growth of Test Cricket</u></h3>
<p>When the Imperial Cricket Conference (as it was originally called) was founded in 1909, only England, Australia and South Africa were members. West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) became Test nations before World War II and Pakistan (1952) soon afterwards. The international game grew with several ICC Affiliate Members being appointed and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, three of those became full members: Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000). They were followed in the early 21st century by Ireland and Afghanistan (both 2018).</p>
<p>Test cricket remained the sport's highest level of standard throughout the 20th century but it had its problems, notably in the infamous "Bodyline Series" of 1932–33 when Douglas Jardine's England used so-called "leg theory" to try and neutralise the run-scoring brilliance of Australia's Don Bradman.</p>

<h3><u>World Series Cricket</u></h3>
<p>The money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian media magnate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Packer">Kerry Packer</a> fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the "rebel" players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.</p>
<h3><u>Limited-over Cricket</u></h3>
<p>In the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship.</p>
<p>Although many "traditional" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.</p>
<p>The first limited-overs international match took place at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground </a> in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International"> limited-overs internationals</a> (LOIs or ODIs—one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup">Cricket World Cup</a> in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.</p><hr>
<h1><u>21st Century Cricket</u></h1>
<p><i>In June 2001, the ICC introduced a "Test Championship Table" and, in October 2002, a "One-day International Championship Table". As indicated by ICC rankings,[23] the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_national_cricket_team">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_national_cricket_team">Ireland.</a></i></p>
<p>The ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cricket_team">United States.</a> In 2004, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Intercontinental_Cup">ICC Intercontinental Cup</a> brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time. Cricket's newest innovation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20">Twenty20</a>, essentially an evening entertainment. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience ratings. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ICC_World_Twenty20">inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup</a> tournament was held in 2007. The formation of Twenty20 leagues in India – the unofficial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Cricket_League">Indian Cricket League</a>, which started in 2007, and the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League">Indian Premier League</a>Indian Premier League, starting in 2008 – raised much speculation in the cricketing press about their effect on the future of cricket.</p><hr>
